# DietDash

### Inspiration
We wanted to create a program that would help us navigate interacting with an interesting API, with all the challenges involved with that to help us learn! It meant making sure we collected and delivered data as required by the API, processed the response appropriately, and otherwise worked within the constraints of a third-party resource. From there, we looked through lists of APIs online for inspiration, and chanced upon a few APIs that deliver recipes based on a series of parameters. We decided to make a meal planning app that can help you decide on breakfast, lunch or dinner for the day or for the week!

### What it does
The user can choose one of two modes: Daily or Weekly. In Daily Mode, the user provides their minimum and maximum # of calories and the diet and health needs they'd like to adhere to. This initiates a call to the API to find a recipe that fits the user's needs. The web app then displays the details about the recipe, including ingredients, nutrition facts, a picture, and a link to the recipe itself. The user can also go back and edit their parameters from this page via the Edit link.

The Weekly Mode is similar, but plans out an entire week, finding meals that all fit the appropriate parameters. It determines how many days of leftovers a recipe will produce based on the number of servings the user provides and distributes meals accordingly. From the weekly result page, the user can click through to each recipe.
